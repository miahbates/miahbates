## About Me
I made the move from Wolverhampton to London six years ago to become a nurse in the big city! For the past three years I’ve have had the honour of caring for patients with complex oncology conditions throughout their cancer journey.

Although I love my job and the patients I never planned this career path as I always dreamed of being a fashion designer when I was younger. My constant desire to make and learn new things has always been pursued in my own time through painting, colouring, drawing (anything which makes mess really). When I’m not covered in paint I’m usually getting around London the best way I know how... on wheels - whether a bike or a pair of rollor-skates! I’ve recently got a new companion ‘Gus' who has not quite got to grips with my modes of transport yet.

## Why Coding?
I’ve always had a passion for learning and development. My introduction into coding came from my frustration with the computer systems within the NHS. My journey began on learn.co with a simple HTML/CSS introduction course. I loved the idea of learning about this world I knew nothing about! I then went on to MOSH programming youtube videos - I loved his style of teaching which I could code along with and perform small challenges through his online courses. This is where I fell in love with CSS, the idea of bringing the page to life through design inspired me.

I then took a Code First Girls ‘introduction into web development’ course which introduced me to the basics of javascript and gave me a taster of what it would be like to work in the industry. We worked in small teams to build a group project. Take a sneaky peak at our webpage which we designed for promotion of plants on mental-health and wellbeing (..and I continue to battle against creating a fully functional search bar!).
